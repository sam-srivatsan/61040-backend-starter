REMOVE calendaring such that each group has events
- each member in the group can post an event
- get events by group id: when you have the group id, be able to return all the calendar events
- you no longer need a get event by member/user - it is only a group thing
- the owner would be a group id
- to check whether person can edit events, check if they are a group member
